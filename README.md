# Daena
Daena is a discord bot which gives build details of genshin impact characters for different roles.

# How to contribute:
- Download or clone this repository
- To add character build details go to the location `/CharacterBuilds/Beginner/`
- Now create a json file with the character's name. example: `ayaka.json`
- Now you can add details. See `character.json` in this repo. It's the template that says how you can add the details of the build. If you only know certain builds you can leave the other details empty.
- Now you are all set you can create a pull request and I will check every detail and merge the details.

**Don't ask me why there are two folders in `/CharacterBuilds/` I actually forgot why I created two folders lol**
