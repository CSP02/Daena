# Daena
Daena is a discord bot which gives build details of genshin impact characters for different roles.

# How to contribute:
- Download or clone this repository
- To add character build details go to the location `/CharacterBuilds/Beginner/`
- Now create a json file with the character's name. example: `ayaka.json`
- Now you can add details. See `character.json` in this repo. It's the template that says how you can add the details of the build. If you only know certain builds you can leave the other details empty.
- Now you are all set you can create a pull request and I will check every detail and merge the details.


# Support

Daena has almost all the character build's (and team compositions coming soon). But they might not be the best because the data was taken direclty from few users and from kqm website. So for this reason it will be appreciated if you guys test daena and send feedback on the bot.
